#Javascript 'Game of Fifteen' solver

I set myself the task of writing a javascript solution to the classic sliding tile puzzle game [Game of Fifteen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

There is no real application for this code, I did it more for the challenge than anything else. Feel free to read through the code, it is well commented.

##Dependencies
I use jquery to interface with the DOM, and I also use a free Google font, but that's it.
